    <h1><u><B><BIg>I) What is GIT?</BIg></B>  </u></h1>
 <p>Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with 
    speed and efficiency. It helps you keep track of code changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage different
     versions of your codebase. </p>

<h2> Key features of GIT;</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <LI> <B>Distributed:</B></LI> Each developer has a local copy of the entire project history, allowing for offline work and faster operations compared to centralized systems.
<LI> <B>Branching and Merging: </B></LI> Git supports creating branches for different features or experiments, allowing for parallel development and easy merging of changes back into the main codebase.
<LI> <B>Commit History: </B></LI> Git meticulously tracks all changes, enabling developers to revert to previous versions, understand the evolution of the project, and identify who made what changes.
<LI><B>Collaboration: </B></LI> Git facilitates seamless collaboration by allowing developers to share their changes with each other, review code, and merge contributions efficiently.
<LI><B> Open Source and Free: </B></LI> Git is an open-source project, meaning it's free to use and has a large community 
supporting its development.

 <h1><u><big>II) What is GitHUB? </big></u></h1>
 <P>GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses 
    Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task
     management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.</P>

     <h1><u><big>III) GIT vs GitHUB </big></u></h1>
<P> While Git is a version control system, GitHub is a popular cloud-based hosting service that provides a platform to host and 
    manage Git repositories. Git is the tool, and GitHub is the place to store and collaborate on Git repositories.</P>
